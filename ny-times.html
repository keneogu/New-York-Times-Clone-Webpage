          <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young 
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s 
            appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
            equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
          </p>
          <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he 
            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
            A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could 
            have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a 
            repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
            of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
          </p>
          <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the 
            heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, 
            warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the 
            wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but 
            would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          </p>
          <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of 
            the page and drew a double box around it.
          </p>
          <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported 
            that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that 
            his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
          </p>
          <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <span><a>the first sliver of cosmic 
            time</a></span> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his 
            colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
          </p>
          <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be 
            proved.
          </p>
          <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast 
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>
          <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta 
            water boiling over.
          </p>
          <p><strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong></p>
          <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of 
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
          </p>
          <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-
            universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, 
            as big as it gets.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, 
            sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
          </p>
          <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath 
            of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a 
            picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as 
            the surface of the sun.
          </p>
          <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known 
            as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers 
            submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only 
            one in 10 million.
          </p>
          <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had 
            not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have 
          been lucky.”
          </p>
          <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who 
            was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.

          <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he 
            tended his radio telescopes.

          <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the 
            most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 
            1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when 
            Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s 
            team, <a>knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a> to tell him 
            the news.

          <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>
          <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>
          <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
              By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>

            Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
          </p>
          <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
